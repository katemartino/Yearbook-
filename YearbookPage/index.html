					An event plaged by rain the year before, this years Student Council Carnival was again threatened to be
					reluctantly moved indoors. But luckily the weather cooperated and the event was held out on the front lawn.
					“This was the first year the carnival was outside - we tried to do it outside last year but it rained. I think
					it went really well. We were contemplating on moving it inside but then we wouldn’t have been able to tie dye
					and have some of the inflatables,” said Rachel Kolb (‘16), a co-chair of the event.
					Made enjoyable by the inclusion of most of the clubs, students were able to walk from
					booth to booth and participate in activities put on by their fellow students. Jessica Olson (‘18)
					remembered “activities like dunking teachers in a tank, tie-dye, live music, and they gave away cotton
					candy and it was actually pretty good.” Evident by the line of students
					spanning across the parking lot, the free cotton candy was a hit with the students.

					Perhaps unsurprisingly, the most popular event was the tie-dye spring fling
					t-shirts hosted by student council. “I think tie dying was also a huge success because you
					could create your own shirt and personalize it,also student council has never done anything like
					that before so it was different.

					Just a few booths down was the Red Kettle Club table, where club treasurer Lucy Kwiatkowski (‘16)
					was handing out snow cones, “We went with red snow cones because it’s Red Kettle Club.” The group was
					attempting to draw in more members, and strangely enough, meeting attendance doubled the next week.
					Continuing, she said “Looking back, I just remember that my hands were really cold from scooping all the crushed
					ice.
